## About me
I'm a professor at [Facultad de Ingeniería de la Universidad de Buenos Aires](https://www.fi.uba.ar) and a [CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/) reseracher work at [Laboratorio de Fluidodinámica](https://lfd.fi.uba.ar/).

I work in Fluid Fynamics, mostly from experiments, but also developing Reduced Order Models to characterize the main behavior for complex flows. Wake instabilities, boundary layer and separated flows are some of the areas where I have applied methods from Hydrodynamical Instabilities, Dynamical Systems analysis and Data Processing.

I'm interested in vortex dynamics in flows with strong fluid-structure interaction. Engineering problems such as drag reduction in transportation, noise attenuation, power generation are closely related to the distribution and intensity of vortices. Analytical and numerical methods are applied to experimental and numerical data on these topics.

I  also work in collaboration with the new  the French-Argentinian International Research Laboratory IRL: Instituto Franco-Argentino de Dinámica de Fluidos para el Medio Ambiente or Institut Franco-Argentin de Dynamique des Fluides pour l’Environnement, IFADyFE.
