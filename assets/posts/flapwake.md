Drag forces in wake flow contribute to a large part of energy consumption in many
industrial applications, particularly on transport. Strategies in flow control need solid
knowledge on the physical mechanisms that characterizes wake flows. On one hand,
active control involve the introduction of energy (e.g. mobile parts, blowing, suction, $\ldots$ ) in a flow while passive control introduce modifications by changing the
geometry, material, surface termination, etc.
Wake flows are generally describes by the well known Bénard Von Kármán (BvK)
instability, an alternate vortex street pattern. We have worked extensively on the
subject in terms of theory (e.g. [1])and control (e.g. [2, 3])
A particular setup of flexible foils added to the surface of a bluff body was tested
and it can lead to drag reductions. These are due to reconfiguration, see [4], and
hydrodynamical stability properties[5, 6, 7]. On a recent work, [8] obtained drag
reductions that can be applied to a better aerodynamical design of trucks. In the
present work, we propose to study the strong fluid structure interaction experimentally
in wind tunnels for a Dshape body. We will characterize the modifications on the BvK
vortex street by reconfiguration and vibrations of the foils induced by the wake. During
the internship we propose that the following:

1. Measure drag forces for different rigidities and length of flexible foils.
2. Perform visualizations for the near wake flow with proper illumination and tracers.
3. Determine the kinematics of the flexible foils with fast camera acquisitions.
These measurements, our previous experimental data and numerical simulations will contribute to elaborate efficient hydrodynamical designs to eventually reduce energy consumption.
