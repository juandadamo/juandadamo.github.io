The drag forces in wake flows are a major contributor to the energy consumption in many industrial applications, especially in the transportation sector. Strategies in flow control require a solid knowledge of the physical mechanisms that characterize
wake flows. Fundamental aspects of two-and three-dimensional transitions, can be raised from the study of flow dynamics over a rectangular inclined plate. Let us remind that that the wake of a plate normal to a flow is characterized by two rows of
counter-rotating vortices, namely the Bénard-von Kármán vortex street. It has been studied both experimentally and analytically since the early work of von Kármán [1]. On the contrary, when the flow is parallel to a flat plate, a boundary layer problem
is presented. Between these two limits, the flow over an inclined plate presents an interesting behavior first approached by Fage and Johansen [2]. Later Abernathy [3] contributed with a model and measurements for the vortex shedding frequency and
the separation of the free-streamline patterns. A literature review on the inclined plate is available in [4], which analyzes the effect of plate aspect ratio using large eddy simulations. However, the authors overlook the historical findings by Eiffel [5]
that measure drag forces presented in Figure 1. Therefore, we suggest the following activities:
1. Measure drag forces for different plate angles of attack and confirm previous
results of [2, 5].
2. Study the influence of the aspect ratio as proposed by[5, 4].
3. Study on moderate Reynolds numbers, the coupling between the vortex street and
tip vortices form the plate.
